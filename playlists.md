In this section you'll find some of the music playlists I carefully created over the years containing the songs I like the most, or the most interesting ones, roughly subdivided into different genres, moods or likeness.

Unfortunately, I'm currently using Spotify and playlists are only available there, but in the future I want to add a way to download the `.csv` file so that you can import and listen to them in your favourite music streaming platform! [Exportify](https://exportify.net/) is a great free tool for that, btw. And for importing, I've never tried, but tools like Soundiiz, TuneMyMusic or MusConv should work fine.

I grew up mostly listening to neoclassical/piano music ([Ludovico Einaudi](https://ludovicoeinaudi.com/complete-works/) in particular) but then, at about 16-17 I quickly broadened my listening radar to many different genres, including not only pop (my first love was [OneRepublic](https://www.onerepublic.com/music/)) and, some time later, melodic dubstep ([Illenium](https://illenium.com/)), but also some lesser-known, fascinating musical niches like glitch, house, riddim, brostep, chillstep and more ([Just Shapes & Beats](https://www.justshapesandbeats.com/) game and [Neddie](https://www.youtube.com/@NeddieOfficial?themeRefresh=1) YouTube videos being the biggest early influences).

In general, I have a soft spot for well-produced songs, meaning with great mastering, high quality, clever little details, and some nice ear candy. I've listened to so many different songs and genres and I recognize and much appreciate when someone has put the effort to make a track sound unique and extra polished. I prefer not to use music as background, and almost always listen to it when I can give it my full attention.

Below I've put the embeds of the playlists I think you should check out, but if for some reason they aren't loading, you can got to my Spotify profile page where you'll find all the [pinned playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/tufc032h2onz3ugn7ejc1u6db/playlists).
