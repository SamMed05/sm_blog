A review of my achievements of 2023 and my plans for the coming year.

Another year has already passed, and it's time to do a recap of what goals have I achieved this year.

In this review, I won't strictly follow my [last year's list](https://sammed05.github.io/sm_blog/2022/12/31/plans-for-2023) of achievements, to make reading this post a little easier and quicker.

If you are curious about what I've done specifically regarding the last year's list, here it is:

<span class="caption">The list of my achievements for 2023. The ones I actually completed are checked.</span>

Anyway, I already know that [I shouldn't tell people about my goals](https://youtu.be/mKdm5xSZiOA), but I'm working on reducing my intention-behavior gap year by year and these posts help me check whether there has been an improvement in that or not.

Let's jump right in!

#### Game development

Like with last year's review post, I want to start with something that has to do with school.

Last school year (2022/2023) I had the opportunity to work with **Unity** on an extracurricular course about game development. I'm very grateful to my school for giving us students this learning opportunity in such a field, considering how much this is rare to see in Italian schools.

I worked on a little game in a group with other 3 friends and we had a great time both making the game and deepening our knowledge of Unity.

Then, in the summer, I exploited a lot of my free time to remake a video game I had been working on since about 2019. It is about shapes, music and rhythm (but it's not Just Shapes and Beats!) but I still can't talk about the details, unfortunately. I used **FMOD** for the first time to implement the audio mechanics, learning how to use it in parallel with the Unity engine.

However, the complexity and size of the project were underestimated (*what a surprise*) and I couldn't complete the project after a few months. That's not a problem, because I already knew that completing the game would require another couple of years or so, but I currently don't know how I would find all that time in the future, and except during the summers, I don't have much spare time to use. I don't even know if the game idea I had is worth the time required to make it concrete.

<span class="caption">Game development screenshot, with an FMOD window on the bottom-left corner. The temporary name for the game is "RectaPulse". I don't know if I'll keep it or change it...</span>

#### Android app development

In the summer I also decided to learn the new **Android Jetpack Compose** toolkit for building native UI, using the official course as the main reference.

While it's considered a simple tool, it was hard for me to learn this modern set of tools, also because I've never used frameworks like React or Angular that share some similarities (though I always wanted to learn React).

I barely completed the tutorial's projects and I wasn't able to work on my app idea, which for this year at least, will remain just in my head. At least I now know the basics of Jetpack Compose!

#### 3D modeling

It's been two years since I planned to come back to **Blender** and use it more often, but because of working on other projects that lack that necessity, I rarely opened it.

I did once: I was searching for a nice wallpaper for my PC that didn't have the subject in a central position like the default one (to avoid the overlap with my desktop icons) in Windows 11, so I made a Win11-like **wallpaper** using the cloth simulation modifier inside Blender. I made a light and dark version and posted the [result](https://twitter.com/MedianiSamuel/status/1673223482052599808/) on Twitter. Here's a GIF transitioning from the light version to the dark one:

#### Chrome extension

In July, if finished my first **Chrome extension**. It's called [Tabs/Windows Counter and Stats](https://github.com/SamMed05/tab-counter-stats) and it keeps track of the number of tabs and windows opened displaying the data in a chart using Chart.js.

I published the extension on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tabswindows-counter-and-s/oihkkgbnlimoffcljflafghgmaocambp) and later worked on another experimental extension for getting statistics from a Spotify playlist, called [Spotify Playlist Stats](https://github.com/SamMed05/spotify-playlist-stats) (for this latter extension, it may not work anymore and I don't plan on developing it anymore).

I made the Tabs/Windows Counter and Stats extension because historically my browser has been keeping open a ton of tabs constantly, and I always wanted to see the various upward and downward trends in the number of tabs open each day. BTW, this year I finally closed all my tabs! (I'm way more excited than any normal person would be ðŸ˜…).

#### Music Production

Last year I planned on releasing my first album or single, but I didn't make it.

However, I'm much more close to it than last year. I worked a lot of time on **Ableton** and learned many tips, techniques and practices, and I'm now working on a song that finally, for the first time, I'm proud of and confident to release when it's finished. I'm working a lot on it even now in the Christmas holidays, but when school starts again I won't have time to work on it since the summer of next year, so I don't really know when I will be able to record it, polish it, finish it and publish it on the major streaming platforms. I'm already excited but first I'll have to do the hard work :).

#### Video editing and animation

I'm currently creating a video essay on the use of **video games in education**, and I planned to release it on YouTube this year, but it's taking so long to edit and I had to postpone the release to next year. It's very long and I don't have enough footage for it. I might need to cut some parts to be able to finish it in a reasonable time.

I used **DaVinci Resolve** and animated some parts also using its node system. With this in mind, I didn't actually do the kind of animation that you see, for example, in Kurzgesagt videos or similar ones, but I still animated things on the screen and that's something I wanted to learn this year.

#### C/C++ Notes website

On my [C/C++ Notes website](https://c-cpp-notes.vercel.app/), where I put explanations on the basics of (mostly) C++, I made some little updates and corrections and added new dedicated sections for conditional, loops and random numbers. I also made a collection of exercises (providing the code solution) that you can try to put the theory into practice.

I can't say that I finished it, but I made quite some progress. However, I'm not sure if I'll continue it in the next year. After all, now with AI chatbots you can get almost the same information I put in my notes just as easily as by consulting the website (even more, actually), so it would no longer make much sense to spend time on this project, that was born to simplify learning for beginners.

#### Other achievements this year

This year I:
- got the driver's license
- started using Notion
- had a minor surgery
- I went abroad (to York, UK) for the first time
- made a long list of my favorite useful websites from around the Internet ([useful links](https://sammed05.github.io/sm_blog/useful-links/))
- wrote a diary shortly describing the progress I have made every day of the year (using Logseq)
- made a new CV with the great open-source tool [RxResume](https://rxresu.me/)

### <span class="material-icons-outlined" style="color: red;">cancel</span> The failures

Fortunately, they are not a lot!

- The first failure that comes to my mind while writing this blog post is that I only published one new post this year in here. I planned to make more of them but instead, I did less than last year. I think that's because of a combination of fewer relevant things to say and more other things to do outside blogging, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.
- I didn't use Python nor learn Manim, as I intended to do for the last few years.
- I wasn't able to increase my visibility online since I still haven't finished the video and the song I talked about earlier. I want to change this next year.
- I didn't go to the gym this year. I decided not to join it because of my surgery and the fact that I was busy with getting the driving license and working on my projects almost full-time during the summer. Next year, I want to join it again and hopefully be more persistent in my commitment. 
- I haven't started working, yet. I still rely financially on my parents and don't have a source of income of my own. Although that's something very common in my country (Italy), I don't find it particularly good and would really want to change the current situation. However, being so young and inexperienced, finding steady employment is almost impossible. I don't even have a degree.

### <span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="color: #000000;">headphones</span> Content consumption

Aside from using YouTube a lot, mainly for educational and tech content, this year I also listened to a lot of new music, played some games, read a few books and watched some movies.

#### Music

I discovered, especially in the last few months, how much I enjoy listening to the **Melodic Dubstep** genre, with artists like ILLENIUM and Seven Lions. The song I'm currently working on is in this same genre, indeed (and a mix of other ones too).

In general, my favorite artist is still OneRepublic. This year for the first time I went to a concert with a friend of mine to see them in Mantova. It was one of the most wonderful experiences of my life!

According to my Spotify Wrapped, my favorite song was Let's Hurt Tonight and my favorite genre was "Pop".

<span class="caption">Spotify Wrapped 2023.</span>

By the way, if you want to listen to the same music I enjoy listening to, this year I also made a public [playlist of my favorite songs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4iriTYwxqDJ5ncNNBNTZCZ) so that you can use it too. You'll see there are a ton of different genres and types of music, and I continue adding more to it from time to time.

#### Books

I read the incredible book "*A World Without Work: Technology, Automation and How We Should Respond*" by the economist Daniel Susskind. It made me deeply and very critically reflect on the future of humanity, when machines will overcome humans, and is a read I highly recommend.
I also read the much shorter novel "*The Old Man and the Sea*".

#### Video games

This year I played the following games for the first time, either on PC or Nintendo Switch:

- Night In The Woods (highly recommended)
- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (yes, very late)
- Vampire Survivors (addictive)
- What Remains of Edith Finch (unexpected)
- The Stanley Parable
- Antichamber
- PICO PARK
- The Last Campfire
- It Takes Two
- Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe (after playing the Wii game a long time ago)
- Papetura
- Unravel Two
- Outer Wilds
- Super Mario Wonder
- No Man's Sky

I still haven't finished some of them, but they all were great games to play. I also finished Ori and The Will of the Wisps considering it one of the best games I've ever played.

#### Movies

I watched both old and new ones:

- Avatar: The Way of Water
- Denial
- Dune
- Interstellar
- The Adam Project
- Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
- Nimona
- Uncharted
- Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them
- The Lord of the Rings (all trilogy)
- The Truman Show
- The Creator
- Inception
- Arrival
- Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse
- Top Gun: Maverick

### <span class="material-symbols-outlined">event_list</span> Plans for 2024

       // Else remove from state
        else if (cbstate[this.name]) {
          delete cbstate[this.name];
        }

       // Persist state
        localStorage.CBState = JSON.stringify(cbstate);
      });
    }
  });
})();
</script>

Ultimately, of course, the goal is to be happy, but this is more of a general lifestyle than a "next year commitment."

That's all for now.

Happy New Year! ðŸŽ‡ðŸŽ†
