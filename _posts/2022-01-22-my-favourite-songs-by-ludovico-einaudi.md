A list of my personal favourite Ludovico Einaudi's songs of all time.

Ludovico Einaudi is by far my favourite composer, and the more I listen to his songs, the more I struggle to find the best one. It's hard to choose just one, but among all those he created the list above represents what I personally consider the bests. For each song, I also explain why they are special and what aspects I like the most.

### <span class="material-icons">music_note</span> 1. Experience

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="913" height="395" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2MHsDNV9lgY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Experience is a very minimalistic piece, in terms of melody, but it slowly develops into one of the perfect harmony of piano, violins, cellos and all the other instruments. It's a plethora of emotions, a concentrate of multiple layers of simple melodies that fits perfectly to each other and they all form the backdrop to Daniel Hope's violin, which push the emotional involvement of this song to its limits.

*Album: In a Time Lapse. Year: 2013.*

### <span class="material-icons">music_note</span> 2. Nuvole bianche

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="894" height="503" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sR2W2scFS4Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

This song is very special for me. It's the one that instantly touched my heart and brought me closer to Einaudi's music. It's also one of the most popular songs of him together with Experience, and for good reasons. A big part of the beauty of Nuvole Bianche is its simplicity, which extends throughout the song with just four piano chords and simple but effective melodies, is the reason why it is so peaceful, charming and touching. There are no words to properly describe this song. Just listen to it!

*Album: Una Mattina. Year: 2004.*

### <span class="material-icons">music_note</span> 3. Petricor

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="894" height="723" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43OxI27c5as" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Starting from the title, "*Petricor*" (or *petrichor*) is the distinctive earthy scent produced when rain falls on parched earth. The word comes from the Greek words '*petra*', meaning stone, and '*ichor*', which in Greek mythology refers to the ethereal fluid that flows in the veins of the gods. <br>
The introduction is made up of 5 different notes (A2/C3 - C4 - A3 - E3) where the 1st one is an alternation between two notes (first A2, then C3, then A2 again etc.). Those are played slowly and consecutively in conjunction with the soft cello harmonics, which I think give a sense of mistery and unpredictability to the atmosphere. Then a violin enters timidly and gradually acquires confidence, prompted by the echo of the cello. A bass in the background comes in, then other violins at <b class="highlight-box">[2:06](https://youtu.be/43OxI27c5as?t=126)</b> and the piano finally changes melody. <br>
The way the piano notes are arranged in the song creates a sense of limp in the rhythm and the beat seems *delayed* (for musicians, the compound time signature is *12/8* BTW). The accent is on the lowest of the three repeating notes in the new piano melody, but we hear the accent in the third note, the highest in terms of pitch.

<span class="caption">Each first beat of the rhythm is represented by the blue arrows indicating the corresponding notes. The red arrows indicates the perceived accent on the third notes of every repetition. this is only a little part of the song, but the same principles applies also in the other parts where the piano is playing the ascending reperating melody.</span>

This clever trick (at least this is what I perceive) creates a sense of suspension, as if the ground is missing under your feet, and them re-fall down again.

Another clever trick is the hardly distinguishable melody played by the violins (together with piano and cello) which starts at <b class="highlight-box">[2:41](https://youtu.be/43OxI27c5as?t=161)</b> and at <b class="highlight-box">[4:45](https://youtu.be/43OxI27c5as?t=285)</b>.

To hear it more easily I recommend turning up the high frequencies because it's the range where violins produce their sound. It's also better to use good quality headphones. I made an high-frequency version of the violin part that you can listen to here:

You can also listen to just the violins thanks to the separation of instruments made with [LALAL.AI](https://www.lalal.ai/):

This type of melody is particular because is takes advantage of the fact that the total beats (pulses) for each measure (bar) are 12 and this number is not only divisible by 3 (remember the image of the accents, where the notes are grouped in three), but also by 4. Combining repeating melodies or 3 and 4 notes creates the effect present in Petricor.

![Petricor rhythm](/sm_blog/assets/images/my-favourite-songs-by-ludovico-einaudi-images/petricor-rhythm.png)
<span class="caption">The lines in the first line can be seen as the 1-2-3 melody of the piano, whereas below the lines are the notes of the violin. They both encounter each other at the end because 3Ã—4 and 4Ã—3 (*notes Ã— times-repeated*) is 12 (*total number of lines*). The red line indicates the accent that the violin creates with an high strident sound every 4 bars and you (can hear that very easily because it stands out a lot in the melody). This creates a sort of symmetry and correlates the two different rhythms (piano ðŸ†š violin) together in a common meeting point.</span>

I find this technique really clever and the effect on the piece is simply wonderful. This song hides a lot of techniques that are used very intelligently.

### <span class="material-icons">music_note</span> 4. Night

### <span class="material-icons">music_note</span> 5. Divenire

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="894" height="503" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VAPapYhDSUc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

### <span class="material-icons">music_note</span> 6. Logos (Elements Special Edition)

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="894" height="503" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zrKdeB5uQQg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Logos comes with two versions, but this in particular is the one I like the most. This song was born from a process of experimentation and innovation, enough that it can be difficult to listen to at first. There are some instruments that are not commonly found in music, like the echoing intermittent bass at <b class="highlight-box">[0:56](https://youtu.be/zrKdeB5uQQg?t=56)</b> that provides the rhythm (recognizable at the start of "*Night*", too), the *[musical saw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_saw)* at <b class="highlight-box">[3:20](https://youtu.be/zrKdeB5uQQg?t=200)</b> and what I think is the *[calabash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabash_(percussion))* (an African percussive instrument made out of a gourd, the *Lagenaria siceraria*) at <b class="highlight-box">[2:20](https://youtu.be/zrKdeB5uQQg?t=140)</b>. Also the scale used is unusual. <br>
This is what probably creates the distinctive atmosphere of darkness, fear and anxiety. Those emotions are interrupted in the culmination of the song at <b class="highlight-box">[3:48](https://youtu.be/zrKdeB5uQQg?t=228)</b> where they are masterfully converted in a strong sense of light-heartedness and hope. This creates a lot of contrast in the overall piece and it's why I always find it emotionally beautiful. The powerful and energetic end, then, concludes the work with the atmosphere foretold from the beginning, albeit in an almost unexpected way.

### <span class="material-icons">music_note</span> 7. Elements

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="894" height="723" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YFcjSi0beVQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The innovative instrument of this song is the Fender Rhodes piano, which introduces the melody and hints at the rhythm, which is what I like the most about this song. It's like a strong march that has no intention of stopping, but rather, becomes stronger and stronger with an orchestra of violins tenaciously repeating the same note (or a descending-ascending melody of 8 notes) and after a little pause at <b class="highlight-box">[3:39](https://youtu.be/YFcjSi0beVQ?t=219)</b> it returns even more powerful than before.

*Album: Elements. Year: 2015.*

### <span class="material-icons">music_note</span> 8. Cold Wind (Day 6)

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe width="894" height="723" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k9j2DMjHc7U" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

This song, which is not very famous, may not seem particularly interesting at first, but in the second half it shows off all its expressiveness. Again, it consists of a simple repeating melody, but Einaudi flawlessly takes advantage of this repetitiveness to give a huge emphasis on the change at <b class="highlight-box">[4:50](https://youtu.be/k9j2DMjHc7U?t=290)</b> and <b class="highlight-box">[5:36](https://youtu.be/k9j2DMjHc7U?t=336)</b>, always keeping the feeling of power, energy and strength very high. This keeps going until <b class="highlight-box">[5:52](https://youtu.be/k9j2DMjHc7U?t=352)</b>, when the calm enters and the instruments slowly muffle, almost taken by sleep, and fall silent.
