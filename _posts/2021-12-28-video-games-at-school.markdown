This special post contains a list of educational games and my reflections about the benefits of gaming at school.

With the rising popularity of video games, playing them has become a normal activity for millions of us all over the world. They are popular at every age but especially people of younger generations love them, me included.

I'm not inventing that: today, according to ESA (Entertainment Software Association), nearly 227 million Americans (69% of all USA population) play video games and three quarters of kids under 18 play them weekly! I encourage you to read the [source](https://www.theesa.com/resource/2021-essential-facts-about-the-video-game-industry/) for more interesting stats. Furthermore, in 2018, the Pew Research Center reported in an article ([Teens, Social Media and Technology 2018](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018/)) that 83% of teen girls and 97% of teen boys played video games (whether on a computer, game console or smartphone).

As I said in the previous post, video games are one of my passions since I was younger, and with time I learned that they are not only a way to have fun or to ward off the boredom, but also a precious tool that can be used in many useful ways.

Instead of lingering on the context, I’ll jump directly to the subject of this post and than do the rest.

Lately I’ve come up with something aimed to take advantage of the best benefits of gaming: **bring video games in schools**.

To explain why this rather curious idea holds up, I’ll split my arguments in two different parts: **education** and **society**.

## Education

Most people strictly separate games from learning. When you say "***educational video game***" or "***game-based learning***", some consider that an *oxymoron*, two things that cannot be together. In fact, gaming often gets this bad rap according to which is just a *distraction tool*, the "*killer of education*", but lately the mentality seems to be more open. I strongly think that gaming needs to be taken seriously and not so superficially, and fortunately other people have started to go in this way too.

Also in formal education, games are still often seen just as an unserious and unproductive activity, and the potentials of games for learning often stay undiscovered. But gaming is becoming a new form of interactive content, worthy of exploration.

Video games are **non-linear systems**, where outcomes depend on player choices unlike linear representations such as those of books and films. This makes them a medium that involve interaction with a user to generate visual feedback on a computer or a video device to utilize fun, play, and competition.

Their beauty (and what makes them *fun*) is that they require **active participation** to be played. They contain a host of stimuli and interactions not present in a classroom that make them particularly fitting for new learning methods, especially "*learn-by-doing*". You don’t just sit in front of a screen and wait for the game to be finished.
This is the greatest advantage that education can use in its favour.

Normally, when a student listens to a theory lesson, it rarely participates with great endeavour or resolve and tends more often to passively listen to the teacher. This leads to distraction, indifference and ultimately **incomprehension**, all consequences that strongly hinder the learning process. Also the decision-making skills and the dialogic interaction among students are, if not completely, partially eliminated in this way.

Many techniques have been implemented at school to prevent this: homework, practical lessons/laboratory, group activities/projects, discussions with classmates, flipped classroom and many others. They mostly worked and are still working now, but I think that something important is missing. Something that really engages students to work with attention and commitment and, at the same time, doesn’t feel like a frustrating burden.

That’s exactly where video games are good at!

I want to underline, before going forward, that this post is not a call to slap gaming on top of education as a *panacea*. That wouldn’t work. However, incorporating video games in lessons **not as substitutes of books or explanations** but as **learning enhancers** can be literally *game-changing* for all students!

Loving what you learn is one of the most fundamental things that the school should convey to its students, but it's often the last concern. Inserting game-based learning (not to be confused with *[gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification)*) in school lessons, instead, can better motivate them to study a subject, to grasp its beauty and to see it far more positively. When games are used to teach materials, students go beyond simple comprehension of content and learn new thought processes.

The exciting idea of playing video games would make students more focused, captivated and much more **willing to learn**, and this is what teachers can take advantage of to transmit them useful information about the subject taught.

> “Game-based learning increases motivation and engagement, and if students are more motivated and engaged, they are more likely to stick with it and perform better” — André Thomas, CEO of Triseum

Therefore, being more attractive to learning attention of students, compared to traditional instruction, video games can increase learning motivation promote problem-solving ability, and result in achieving better learning effects.

But of course you can’t just take a random video game and expect it to be educational. Unfortunately, just a **small percentage** of video games currently on the market is suitable for that purpose and has some educational value. Usually game developers aim at entertainment and don’t create much educational content.

However, there are some exceptions. In my experience with gaming I discovered that educational games *exist* and they are not just the boring ones: even some of the most **famous games** in the gaming industry include educational features.

While discovering those hidden games and features, I started making a **list** of the best ones, and now I want to share it with all the reasons why they can perfectly be used for many subjects in schools.

### Assassin’s Creed Discovery Tours

Even if not designed to be educational, some games of the Assassin's Creed series include exactly for that a special separate mode called “Discovery Tour”, like **Assassin's Creed Odyssey** where players can explore the **Ancient Greece** with its general culture, art, religion and everyday life. That’s why this game fits perfectly for an history lesson where students can learn about Greek history themselves through the exploration of a virtual world made specifically for that purpose.

![Assassin's Creed Odyssey Ancient Greece Discovery Tour in class](https://staticctf.akamaized.net/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/7CQbFDaMylfU0h6H8xOWv2/5173f041e026f8c92cb95ed327257057/acdiscovery-gameinfo-promo-02.jpg)
<span class="caption">Demonstration of how this game could be used in classroom. Source: Ubisoft official website.</span>

This is not the only Discovery Tour made by Ubisoft: at the moment of writing there are other two Discovery Tours about **Ancient Egypt** and **the Viking Age**.

### Minecraft Education Edition

This is a special version of Minecraft game that includes specials tools and virtual worlds that can be used by the teacher to create fun and formative learning environments.

With this game, while the students play with Minecraft following the instructions given (teachers have pre-made [lessons](https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/resources/explore-lessons), STEM curriculums and project-based challenges at their disposal), they also work together in an immersive 3D world where they have the possibility to strengthen creativity, spatial visualization ability, problem-solving skills, leadership traits, teamwork, collaboration and social interactions.

This is the [official website](https://education.minecraft.net/), and at this link you can find a useful [guide](https://www.commonsense.org/education/articles/getting-started-with-minecraft-in-the-classroom) on how to use Minecraft (Vanilla version) in class in the best way. Get started with Minecraft Education Edition [here](https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/get-started) and see the [purchasing options](https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/get-started).

![Minecraft Education Edition](/sm_blog/assets/images/video-games-at-school-images/minecraft-education-edition.jpg)

This game works better for younger people, but also students of my age (16/17) and older can benefit from Minecraft and the expressive freedom that it gives to the player.

To provide a real example, my telecommunication professor in this period is teaching me and my classmates the *logic gates*. The interesting thing is that you can make [logic gates in Minecraft](https://youtu.be/9EY_XoEImjM) too, and even with no effort. If just for one day he showed us how they work at school using this game, I can very confidently predict that the level of attention would skyrocket and the same would happen with the understanding of that argument, in comparison with
just chalk and blackboard.

### Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020)

This game is a whole 3D simulation of the Earth that can be used in geography lessons to show from top perspective what is below from cities to rivers, from oceans to forests all over the world.

These are some places in Europe, for example:

<div class="videowrapper"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7fG831GaPtw?list=PL0il2l-B_Wwbueyv-OuE1e9JjQ2bl3FFH" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Being an airplane simulator, it can also be used in particular school courses to teach how to fly these vehicles without actually doing it.

See the [official website](https://www.flightsimulator.com/) for more info.

### Kerbal Space Program

Kerbal Space Program is a famous rocket simulator. On this perspective, it seems not to be applicable to ordinary lessons, but actually the physic modelled in this game is so useful that both NASA and the European Space Agency officially endorse it[^1], and some schools even use this game in order to help teach [math and physics](https://youtu.be/GC1jZ3qIVdQ) and even [rocket science](https://youtu.be/ogC6ds81gek).

![xkcd - Orbital Mechanics](/sm_blog/assets/images/video-games-at-school-images/orbital-mechanics-xkcd.jpg)
<span class="caption">Orbital Mechanics - xkcd. Source: xkcd.com/1356/</span>

The developers at Teachergaming LLC also launched *KerbalEdu*, an educationally-enhanced standalone version of this space agency game (developed by Squad) which integrates features that are exclusive to the classroom. Read [this article](https://www.pcgamer.com/kerbaledu-launches-to-bring-kerbal-space-program-to-more-classrooms/) by PC Gamer for more info. Unfortunately the project is now dead and I cannot ensure that KerbalEdu can still be downloaded and used.

Dan Fullerton, a physics teacher at Irondequoit High School in Rochester, New York, has tried to use this game and others at school to create interest in its students, and these are his words:

> “I think any time you can capture the enthusiasm of a student, you have an opportunity. The trick as an educator is realizing our kids have varied interests, so we need to find ways to tie in what we do to each of their interests.[^2]” — Dan Fullerton

I'll leave the link to the [official website](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/) and an educational [review](https://www.commonsense.org/education/game/kerbal-space-program) of this game by Common Sense Education.

###  Portal and Portal 2

![Portal 2 logo](/sm_blog/assets/images/video-games-at-school-images/portal-2-logo.png)

Portal is another series of games not designed with education in mind, but the creators (Valve) promoted the use of their games for education. This initiative led to the use of Portal 2 in educational school courses, especially for learning STEM disciplines[^3].
The [foundry10.org](http://www.foundry10.org/) organization developed an adaptation of Portal 2 that can be applied in classrooms in a program called [Teach with Portals](http://www.foundry10.org/programs/games-and-learning/portal-2). This project is (well… was 😢) freely available with plenty of video-game-based lessons about gravity, conservation of energy, projectile motion, free fall, geometry, statistics and not only.

This [blog post](https://classroomaid.wordpress.com/2012/11/02/stories-of-learning-with-portal-2/) by Classroom Aid explains in details how teachers used this game and what they taught. Here's the introduction:

> "Since its launch in June 2012, Valve’s free initiative Teach With Portals has brought Puzzle Maker to over 2,500 teachers nationwide, it aims to help teachers use the game Portal 2 to engage students in learning STEM. […] By converting its level-building software, Hammer Editor, into a much easier to use interface called Puzzle Maker, Valve has made it possible for anyone to design challenging Portal rooms".

Sadly, the Steam for School initiative was launched in 2012 and is **now discontinued**. I decided to put this game anyway in the list because it is still a great example of how video games can be integrated with the classroom.

### Triseum Games

Triseum is a company that has developed many educational games. The best one is probably **Variant: Limits**, a calculus game published in 2017 where “students can visually see how manipulating equations impacts graphs, charts and their course of action, and therefore they are encouraged to use a trial and error approach[^4]”.

In this game you wake up isolated on a planet where you were researching with a team about an ancient, technologically advanced culture. You have to develop your understanding of limits to activate gates and bridges throughout the city as you investigate to learn what happened.

*Variant: Limits* connects mathematics and game play, empowering students to take a more active role in the learning process and engage with content on a deeper level. Focusing on finite limits, continuity and infinite limits, students explore, develop new knowledge and practice college-level calculus concepts in the game environment. They don’t just memorize and regurgitate information, but rather apply it. As students achieve learning objectives and advance to higher levels within the game, they are motivated to keep going[^5].

<span class="caption">An example image of the gameplay.</span>

Watch this [video](https://youtu.be/Ys1ShVbkdqQ) to see some gameplay and how it works and read this [review](https://www.commonsense.org/education/game/variant-limits) by Common Sense Education to see in what it's helpful. An interesting thing is that students’ progress is reported to the teacher, so it can monitor the learning state.

I have to say, though, that this game feels a bit incomplete and in an early stage of development, even if it’s already published, and it’s not particularly well made under some perspectives. However, I greatly appreciate that Triseum with its games provides to everyone the demonstration that **video games can be included at school** with many benefits and they help keeping the students invested.

### Other games

- To teach **coding** at younger people, several educational video games has been made in the last years, including [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) (online) and [Rabbids coding](https://register.ubisoft.com/rabbids-coding/), and [Oh my Git!](https://ohmygit.org/) and [while True: learn()](https://luden.io/wtl/) can be really useful for more advanced programmers.
- [TestTubeGames](https://testtubegames.com/games.html) is an online collection of little science education games about many topics about **chemistry**, **physics** and more.
- [Quantum Moves 2](https://www.scienceathome.org/games/quantum-moves-2/) and [A Slower Speed of Light](http://gamelab.mit.edu/games/a-slower-speed-of-light/) are also a good way to learn physics (respectively **quantum physics** and **special relativity**).
- Serious Games Interactive is a company that makes, well… serious games! The most interesting is probably [Newt & Byte – Climate Adventures](https://www.seriousgames.net/en/portfolio/climatescience/), "a climate science educational programme that teaches children the science behind climate change". To use it, though, we still need to wait: the games is currently being tested in schools in Denmark, Austria and Australia and it's not publicly available.
- The great people at Common Sense Education made also a top-40 list of educational games (some of the already mentioned here) that you can check [here](https://www.commonsense.org/education/top-picks/best-summer-learning-games).
- On GitHub there's a curated list of online educational games and interactive experiences called [Awesome Educational Games](https://github.com/yrgo/awesome-educational-games) where people all over the world can always contribute adding new links.

### Feasibility: is it possible?

As you can see from the list above, some games with educational features already exist. However, **some problems and barriers** emerge when we try to implement video games in education:

##### 1. Economic and organization problem
One problem is that most of the time video games require machines powerful enough to run them.
This can be an economic issue both for students, who don't always have enough money to permit a powerful PC/console and for schools, that oftentimes have old, slow computers and a *very* limited budget. My school, for instance, falls into this latter case. These issues arise depending on if video games are played at home or at school (individually or together) and they are not easily solvable. Moreover, each game runs on different platforms (some are exclusive to one platform only, so just PC/Windows, just PlayStation 4/5, just Xbox and so on) and you can't always expect, from school and from students, to have them all.

Also, teachers and the whole school system are not prepared for video games, so there's a lack of supporting materials. Educators don't have access to supporting text or work for students to do alongside games because they do not exist yet.

*WeAreTeachers* conducted a survey of 309 K–12 classroom teachers from public, private and religious schools across the country (USA) and published an [article](https://www.weareteachers.com/what-do-teachers-think-of-game-based-learning-2/) about it.

As commented by a Classroom Aid in a [post](https://classroomaid.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/what-k-12-teachers-think-about-game-based-learning/):

> "[the survey] shows more technologies and helps are needed for game-based learning to be broadly implemented into classrooms. […] There are still gaps waiting to be bridged, for examples, building learning games more closely tied to education goals, or helping teachers to design learning activities with game-like mechanism for their lesson goals."

##### 2. Disinterest of school and older people
The other obstacle that precludes students from exploiting video games at school is the absolute and complete **disinterest** (and perhaps even **distrust**) of the school system towards this powerful tool. In my experience, at least, I've never heard of some school project or innovation with the goal of using video games at school, neither for teaching nor for entertainment.

For now, **in Italy** at least, not many schools are prepared for this. My hope is that in the future more and more educational institutes will promote the idea of bringing game-based learning to school to use it for the benefit of the students and the whole school community, but I also look for the Ministry of Education[^6] to allocate more funds and implement new reforms of the school system to make this really happen. The challenge is convincing all schools that video games are legitimate tools to use in K-12 education, like said by Andrew Vaccaro in the awesome post "[Games in education](https://mcdermottscholars.wordpress.com/2015/06/05/games-in-education/)".

##### 3. Gender difference
Another problem is the gender difference: in 2008, a Pew Internet & American Life Project study found that among teens, 65% of men and 35% of women describe themselves as daily gamers. This trend was found to be stronger the younger the age group[^7]. This is really bad when a teacher try to use video games to engage students, because not all of them become interested and have fun, especially women.

Like written in the abstract of this paper:

> "Educational games are commonly<span class="tooltip">`*`<span class="tooltiptext">(well, never in my experience)</span></span> used to help motivate students and provide enhanced learning opportunities.  However, because of **gender differences** in how males and females play games, **concerns regarding potential gender inequity arise when games are used for education**[^8]."

And in this other paper, in the conclusion:

> "The present study found significant gender differences in the video gaming of Norwegian 11–19-year-olds. The quantitative part showed a high proportion of gamers among boys regardless of age, but less gaming among girls with increased age. […] Gender differences in gaming behavior and experiences are not necessarily problematic. However, our study found that adolescent girls have a more limited scope in gaming[^9]."

- [Frontiers in Psychology - Measuring Female Gaming: Gamer Profile, Predictors, Prevalence, and Characteristics From Psychological and Gender Perspectives](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00898)
- [Classroom Aid - What Do Students Think about Video Games?](https://classroomaid.wordpress.com/2012/11/02/what-do-students-think-about-video-games/)

##### 4. Lack of educational games and interest of developers
One more thing: as I said before, educational video games take only a very small slice of the market among video games in circulation today. That being said, if this type of video games were used more and more often, **an increasing number of developers and companies around the world would aim to create educational video games**. Their interest would increase with insured buyers<span class="tooltip">`*`<span class="tooltiptext">Game creators and publishers would be sure that some people who would buy their games exist.</span></span> and they would more willingly approach this new type of market than before. They could also make special sales offers designed for schools (like a decreased price for a mass purchase of the same product) and the Government could promote their work with economic bonuses (after all, they create something educational and financing them means contributing to the progress of society, I think). Lately, I see that companies are starting to take this opportunity seriously and I am really happy about it!

### Are educational games *truly* fun?

Putting aside the feasibility, another aspect of educational video games (and [edutainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_entertainment)) remains: it's not always guaranteed that they are "fun".

Some time ago, I read a post by Nabeel Qureshi titled "[Video Games are the Future of Education](https://nabeelqu.co/education)". In addition to providing me some food for thought and insights, it also linked an [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23593872) with interesting discussions about the presence (or absence) of this fundamental part, the fun part, in educational games.

The main problem to face with this type of game is the prejudices of people. Imagine a teacher that enters in a class of young students and said: "*Today we are going to play videogames, but not the regular ones: we'll play educational games!*".

Although I have never had the opportunity to live this (rather particular 😅) experience, I think I can realistically imagine the students' reaction to those words: an initial hype and excitement that suddenly dies out in hearing the word "*educational*".

Tying me in with this little example, I would like to address this point: in practice, **educational games are not as fun as regular ones**.
This can be detectable in all kinds of educational video games and especially the younger ages  consider these games boring. After all, if children want to have fun they just play fun games, not educational one.

Of course, this impacts the effectiveness of video games at school. Students usually doesn't trust teachers when they say that something educational is fun (like a lesson on a particular topic, not only a video game), but I think that it wouldn't create so much damage.

You can't expect to have everything. A game can't be really fun and really educational all at the same time, so some adaptations and compromises need to be made.

I think that a bit of fun is present even in the most boring game, and furthermore, I'm sure that gaming is always more engaging and fun than studying alone on the books. There's no need to worry about this point.

### Pros and Cons

Learning games, like everything, have **pros** and **cons**.

Perhaps one of the biggest is the inability for teachers to have a clear cut way of including video games into the rigid school curriculum. They could stumble upon difficulties when trying to merge traditional learning with game-based one, and also in finding topics connected both to games and theory lessons.

It's also difficult to keep under control the students and their unpredictable behaviour when games are involved. Since teachers and students have different visions of video games, in the end it can happen that they don't become educational at all. "Simply referencing or bringing games into a classroom does not a relevant lesson make"[^10].

This table illustrates well some of the controversies about game-based learning:

## Society

Ok, I think I talked enough about educational video games. Now, since this is a personal blog, I want to talk about another thing that I experienced in first person that correlates with video games at school too. But instead of talking about educational games, I want also to talk about them in general in this part. I hope it can give you a better understanding on how this set of benefits applies to reality also with regular video games.

As a premise, in this context for *society* I don't mean the whole global society of human beings, but just the little group of people inside a school and the social interaction with classmates and teachers in a class. This, though, doesn't exclude that what I say can be applicable also outside of the school environment.

In my years of education, in all of them, I've noticed the manifestation of a common behaviour among my classmates/friends.
Every school year there’s at least one short period, but often even more, where my classmates and I find a video game to play together with our smartphones<span class="tooltip">`*`<span class="tooltiptext">I understand that playing video games at school (regular ones) sounds like a very childish activity to do, but keep reading because I think it's a wrong way of seeing them.</span></span>.

Usually what happens is the following: <br>
when one of us finds and shares it, many of us in a few days have already installed the same game, so that during the free time (like the 15 minutes break we have) we can play in online co-op (multiplayer) mode.

To cite some famous examples, that game can be *Call of Duty Mobile*, *Among Us* or *Clash Royale*. Indeed, these three games were the most popular games played during my last three years of upper secondary school, 2019 (first), 2020 (second) and 2021 (third) respectively. The selection of which (free) game to play often depended on which game was the most in vogue in that moment all over the world, but sometimes we would rediscover old games and play them again (for example recently we are playing *Rento*, a 2016 online multiplayer monopoly board game).

<span class="caption">Some games we played together.</span>

Playing with my friends these games is a very fun activity, and I think that it's something important to us even if no one notice it.

When we play together, we spontaneously strengthen the bonds of friendship, we entertain our mind, we take a break from the real world for a moment and we simply have *fun*.

> "Gaming for both children and adults alike serves as a common interest and point of conversation which can create bonds and enhance social skills. Multi-player and online games allow for constant communication between players which results in the development of both meaningful and casual relationships.[^11]"

> "Face-to-face relationships and those formed within online gaming communities both provide what we call social capital, which is an all-encompassing term for the social resources that make a friendship a friendship. […] Online, game-rooted friendships are as real as any offline friendships, and they shouldn’t be discredited just because they’re mediated through technology.[^12]"

That's why I think that using games at school can be helpful for our mind and for the individuals of society to be more connected with each other. It's something that school tries to do, too, but for us students there's often too little time to really stay together, to have fun and smile instead of just studying and working hard. With this I don't want to portray the school as a place of sadness and suffering. I just want to say that in addition to the moment in which the lesson is given it is also important to have a moment in which to talk, discuss and have fun with others, and video games help us to do so.

It's true that sometimes games (and the technology in general) becomes the students' addiction and precludes us to relate with the outside world. All can be dangerous if abused and taken to extreme.

If used correctly, though, multiplayer games (unlike social medias, for example) can be helpful to stay together having fun and for that reason I think they have an important role in the school environment. In moments of pause, they should not be banned or stigmatized as a violent or isolating tool, because they actually promote conversations and confrontations among people while they are entertained.


### Conclusions

Curiously, before writing this article I was planning just to make a little list of games and write down some of my thoughts. Eventually it turned out to be probably the longest post in my blog. Not only for the word count, but also for the time taken (16 December – 28 December). The reason for that probably lies into the fact that I'm discovering that I'm really interested in education, and mixing this interest with video games, another great passion of mine, is a really effective combo! "*Video games at school*" turned out to be a far more interesting topic to discuss than I initially thought.

Anyway, as demonstrated, video games can be helpful in many *many* ways, not just for entertainment needs. If you were initially against what was I said, I hope that now this post changed your vision and I wish that this can be a stimulus for all people to slowly make these ideas a reality.
