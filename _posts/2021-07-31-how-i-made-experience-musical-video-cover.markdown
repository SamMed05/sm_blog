In this post I'm going to explain the process behind the cover video I posted on July 18<sup>th</sup> of the song Experience by Ludovico Einaudi.

I donâ€™t remember exactly when I discovered Experience. <br>
I do remember, though, that I didnâ€™t liked it particularly when I listened to it for the first times. <br>
Sure, it was beautiful, but initially it didnâ€™t give me the sensations I was used to with other Ludovico Einaudi songs. And thatâ€™s probably the reason why I wasnâ€™t so interested on this song for the first few listenings: until then I preferred to hear only the pure and calm sound of the piano without any other instrument "interfering"<span class="tooltip">`*`<span class="tooltiptext">Well, actually other instruments don't *interfere* with piano, but before I still didn't like hearing the sounds of other instruments on top of it.</span></span>. <br>
Now, over time my musical tastes have evolved to the point of abandoning that quite limiting idea for my musical choices; however, at that time the **guitar**, the solo **violin**, the **cellos** and (especially) the **tambourine** were still difficult for my ear to *digest*. <br>
I'm not saying they should not be there, I just wasnâ€™t ready to listen to them yet. <br>
But now I have completely understood why every instrument is there and the perfect harmony it creates with the others. I am finally ready to fully and correctly respect, value, appreciate and admire this song.

#### The inspiration:

There are many reasons that made me want to do this:
1.	Firstly, I love this song so much, itâ€™s probably my favourite ever (even if itâ€™s difficult to express absolute preferences when it comes to music).
2.	Secondly, when I was listening to it I was imagining how nice it would have been to see **multiple copies of myself playing every part of every instrument together in synch** in a kind of split-screen video, like I saw in the past in other similar videos and some moments in the Einaudi's live video. This song was perfect for it because instruments join one after the other (sometimes more than one) in progression.
3.	Lastly, the more I was listening to Experience, the more I was realizing that it wasn't impossible to make, considering also that I already knew how to play the piano and guitar part and so the idea started to seem more and more viable.
Listening to it made the desire to feel the emotions of playing every instrument to grow in me even more.

So, three month ago I decided to start making this project.

### <span class="material-icons">videocam</span> My video:
<div class="videowrapper"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_0z_PiUxOA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

*Before proceeding, while you are watching the video if you haven't already seen it, I would like to do some clarifications:*

#### What I don't have:
- A professional camera
- A professional microphone
- A professional violin
- A cello
- A tambourine
- A recording studio
- A professional video editing software

#### What I have:
- A piano
- A (good) guitar
- A violin
- A cello VTS by Bigcat Instruments
- A smartphone
- A easel
- Various softwares (more afterwards)

So, as you can see, I adapted to what I had and I gave my best to get the best results possibleâ€¦ Of course the **sound quality**, the **technique** and the **playing of the instruments is not even remotely comparable** to the original registration. <br>
As can be seen in the list above I don't have a professional equipment, unfortunately, so the sound quality is quite poor. <br>
Iâ€™m just me and the instruments, I canâ€™t do better in a reasonable amount of timeâ€¦

### The process:
I started by listening carefully and doing a breakdown of all the instruments. <br>

As I said before, I already knew the piano notes for this song for some time, they are very easy. <br>
The tempo for this song (the album version) is between 92 and 93 bpm, so I used <b class="highlight-box">92.5 bpm</b>. <br>
This song has two main (very similar) versions, but they differ for duration, tempo and instruments. Since in one is used the harp and in the other is used the guitar, and I donâ€™t have an harp, I chose the latter, then realizing that its part was quite difficult (but doable) to play at that tempo.

The **violin** part was very difficult for me because **I started practicing that instrument just a few months ago, in April, as a complete beginner**. <br>
I was fortunate because my fingers were already a bit trained thanks to having played piano and guitar for some years, but violin is still very different. <br>
If you are a musician too, Iâ€™m sure you noticed that I donâ€™t always keep the bow correctly and straight, some notes are out of tune and several other errors in my performance. Iâ€™m aware of it and I apologize but I'm still at the beginning of my learning journey with violin.

The next part to learn was the tambourine, but since I donâ€™t have it, I used a djembe (a typical African drum) with my left hand pressed on it as a "mute" to imitate the *real* tambourine sound. <br>
The technique used to hit it is particular and took me a few days to learn it. Again, excuse any error please, I am clearly a novice drum player.

<span class="iconify" data-icon="icon-park-outline:thinking-problem"></span> A curiosity: this hitting technique is also used in the "pizzica salentina", a Salento type of tarantella, a dance technique practiced particularly in southern Italy.

Finally, I used the free Sonatina Cello sample library and FL Studio to add digitally the sound of the cello because I donâ€™t have it too. To do this, I listened to the song and tried to guess by ear the right notes. <br>
I think I they are exactly like the original, but I could be wrong. Furthermore, sometimes I intentionally changed a bit the notes for some instruments for practical reasons.

The overall time it took to make my cover was about 3 months, even if the planning had already started a bit before.

### The softwares:

In post-production I used:
- Audacity <img class="small-img" src="/sm_blog/assets/images/experience-cover-images/audacity-logo.png" alt="FL Studio logo" /> to cut/edit the audio recordings,
- FL Studio <img class="small-img" src="/sm_blog/assets/images/experience-cover-images/fl-studio-logo.png" alt="FL Studio logo" /> to make the cello parts,
- OBS Studio <img class="small-img" src="/sm_blog/assets/images/experience-cover-images/obs-studio-logo.png" alt="OBS Studio logo" /> to record the screen,
- OpenShot <img class="small-img" src="/sm_blog/assets/images/experience-cover-images/openshot-logo.png" alt="OBS Studio logo" /> to cut, mix and synchronize all the video clips together,
- Subtitle Edit <img class="small-img" src="/sm_blog/assets/images/experience-cover-images/subtitle-edit-logo.png" alt="OBS Studio logo" /> to add subtitles in rhythm.

Trying to synch every single clip all together with the right tempo made me clash with many problems: merging multiple videos at the same time has both **overloaded my PC** and **created audio clipping**; despite these sufferings, fortunately in the end I was able to complete my job and fix (almost) everything (some audio clipping and bad synchronization is still there in some parts, but before it was much worse!).

Also sizes changed drastically (I would never have thought so much), after cutting and deleting the wrong/bad  recordings:

<span class="caption">Oh, so satisfying...</span>

### Conclusions:

I need to thank a lot Bigcat Instruments for its free digital musical instruments, including the cello sound that I used. You can download it and other instruments in the links below[^1].

I think that this video would be very useful for practicing, and I would be really happy if my video would help with that! <br>
For that reason I added subtitles <span class="iconify" data-icon="ic:baseline-subtitles"></span> with Subtitle Edit in order to display which instruments and when they join with the others in the song. I don't know if it can be useful, but certainly doesn't hurt. ðŸ™‚ <br>
Moreover, I started to learn and practice violin especially to play this song!

I need to say it: it was an incredible Experience! Thanks for reading.
