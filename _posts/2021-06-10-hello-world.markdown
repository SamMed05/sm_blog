In the following post I'm going to introduce this blog and talk a bit about me and future plans.

The intention of writing a blog has been in my head for a long time: sometimes I need to pause and meditate and I thought writing was a good way to do it. I've never been a procrastinator, but between uncertainty about *when* to write, *what* to write and *what* technologies to use, I always postponed this idea. <br>
I'm currently 16 years old, so for about 50% of the days in a year I have (and I need to) go to school[^1] and I can't blog or doing other things because of the fewer time. <br> In the afternoon during my free time I have almost never prioritized this activity until now, I rather went out with friends, played the piano, the guitar or the violin, created or played video games, read a book, etc. <br>
By the way, you can find more information about me on <a href="https://samdev.netlify.app" target="_blank">my personal website</a><box-icon name='link-external' size='xs'></box-icon> or in the about page, and I'm also planning to write a post that dive a bit more in my past. <br>
Most of the time I'll have to do my duties, like every other person, and my hobbies (and so my blog too) will be slowed down, but at least during summers and holidays, like in this moment, I will have all the time needed.

*Just to clarify: I often envy those who are, but unfortunately I'm not native speaker of English, **Italian** is my first language. I apologize if there are writing errors, but I will do my best to avoid them.*

<br>

## FAQ time!

#### What will be written in this blog?
I really wanted to share the *tons* of interesting thoughts, hobbies and passions that I experience and possess during my life, but I never had a good place to write them down.
Instead of keeping these things just inside me and oppressing this necessity, I finally decided that it was time to take a more extrovert approach and start writing a collection of them in a blog. <br>
I'm not going to put too technical things and I don't want to use a difficult language. I'd like to write something which is understandable and enjoyable by anyone who reads it. Also, I'd like to talk about similar things on my YouTube channel, but here I can tell them in a faster and simpler way.
I don't think you will ever see tutorials in this blog because for that I would prefer using other ways. Anyway I could always change idea, time will tell.

#### Why (and why should it be read)?
I'd just like writing down and share with other people my thoughts, my hobbies, my passions and, in general, my approach with life, my way of living and thinking with the world (respecting the life principles of everyone else, I want to underline it). <br>
Forcing myself to expose my *mental things* out loud ensure the clarity, the honesty and the transparency of my thoughts and strengthens them. <br>
This however must not damage the habit of having an open mentality and being able to listen to everyone's opinions, and I am aware of it.
I think that having common topics to share and discuss is important for a healthy evolution of society, and it helps us to know ourselves more deeply. <br>

As I recently read [in this blog post](https://billmei.net/blog/why-blog):

> <span class="iconify" data-icon="bx-bxs-quote-alt-left" data-inline="false"></span> The blog format is nice because people expect blogs to function as a kind of public diary, so compared to coffee chats it’s not as awkward to bring up a subject like “what gives your life purpose?” <span class="iconify" data-icon="bx-bxs-quote-alt-right" data-inline="false"></span> — Bill Mei

Making a blog for me means also that I can improve my writing skills, both for English and Italian languages.
Already the fact that you are reading this is a hint that you might like what I write and that it might be interesting and useful to you. At least I hope it!

#### How often will new posts come out?
As I said before, there are long periods where I'm too busy to blogging, but I can safely say that during the summer I will be much more active than any other period of the year. <br>
Anyway, posts will not come out at a regular rate, also because I need topics to talk about and they come as time passes (but lately I'm listing a lot of ideas). <br>
This activity, as much as many others, requires time end effort to be completed, especially if I'm looking a high quality standard.
I'm not going to publish new posts until I'm not 100% (ok... maybe 99,97% <span class="iconify" data-icon="bx-bx-wink-smile" data-inline="true"></span>) sure that they are good. <br>
There is also another reason to publish posts after some time: there are some arguments for which the personal opinion could change even after a few time during the reflection and writing process, so I want to be sure that I don't say something that does not correspond to my real thoughts.

#### How it's made this blog?
I'm not assuming that you are a programming enthusiast, so I don't want to go into details. In general I'm using Jekyll <span class="iconify" data-icon="cib:jekyll" data-inline="false"></span>, a blog-aware static site generator and Markdown <span class="iconify" data-icon="cib:markdown" data-inline="false"></span> for writing the formatted text.
I used Alembic theme by David Darnes but I modified it until it suited my tastes. <br>
I made this blog in about a week's time, first post included. It seems like a short time but actually I worked many hours on it these days and is was not easy, especially changing the theme, tweaking it's CSS and adding extra features like icons or the top-button ⤒. <br>
It' not perfect yet, there are a lot of errors, but I will continue to improve it. <br>

[^1]: A little curiosity: probably it's a bit different abroad, but here in Italy school is attended in the morning for 5/6 hours and it lasts roughly 200 days, usually starting around 15<sup>th</sup> September and ending on 6<sup>th</sup> June.
