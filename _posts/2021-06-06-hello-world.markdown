<span class="first-letter">T</span>he intention of writing a blog has been in my head for a long time.

I've never been a procrastinator, but between uncertainty about when to write, what to write and what technologies to use, I always postponed this idea. <br>
I'm currently 16 years old, so for about 50% of the days in a year I'm at school and I can't blog[^1] or doing other things. <br> In the afternoon during my free time I have never prioritized this activity until now, but rather I went out with friends, played the piano, created or played video games, read a book, etc. <br>
(By the way, you can find more information about me on <a href="https://samdev.netlify.app/" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;">my personal website</a><box-icon name='link-external' size='xs'></box-icon> or in the about page, and I'm also planning to write a post that dive a bit more in my past.) <br>
Most of the time I'll have to do my duties, like every person on earth, and my hobbies (and so my blog too) will be slowed down, but at least this cannot be said during the summer and holidays like in this moment.

*Just to clarify: I often envy those who are, but unfortunately I'm not native speaker of English, **Italian** is my first language. I apologize if there are writing errors, but I will do my best to avoid them.*

<br>

Let's go with the FAQ!

#### ❚ What will be written in this blog?
I really wanted to share the *tons* of interesting thoughts, hobbies and passions that I experience and possess during my life, but I never had a good place to write them down.
Instead of keeping these thoughts just inside me and oppressing this necessity, I finally decided that it was time to take a more extrovert approach and start writing a collection of them in a blog.
I'm not going to put too technical things and I don't want to use a difficult language. I'd like to write something which is understandable and enjoyable by anyone who reads it. Also, I'd like to talk about similar things on my YouTube channel, but here I can tell them in a faster and simpler way.

I don't think you will ever see tutorials in this blog because for that I would prefer using another way. Anyway I could always change idea, time will tell.

#### ❚ Why (and why should I read this blog)?
I'd just like writing down and share with other people my thoughts, my hobbies, my passions and, in general, my approach with life, so my way of living and thinking with the world in which we all live (respecting the life principles of others).
I think that having common topics to share and discuss is important for a healthy evolution of society.
Already the fact that you are reading this is a hint that you might like what I write and that it might be interesting and useful to you. At least I hope it!

#### ❚ How often will new posts come out?
As I said before, there are long periods where I'm too busy to blogging, but I can safely say that during summers (therefore in the school holidays) I will be much more active than any other period of the year. Anyway, posts will not come out at a regular rate, also because I need arguments to talk about and they come as time passes (but lately I'm listing a lot of ideas). <br>
This activity, as much as many others, requires time end effort to be completed, especially if I'm looking a high quality standard.

#### ❚ How do you made this blog?
I don't want to go into details, but in general I'm using Jekyll <span class="iconify" data-icon="cib:jekyll" data-inline="false"></span>, a blog-aware static site generator and Markdown <span class="iconify" data-icon="cib:markdown" data-inline="false"></span> for writing the formatted text.
