In this post I'll share my thoughts about a situation I recently found myself in.

*Three months have passed since my last post. Lately, I've been busy with school and other projects so that's the reason for such a long period of inactivity. I can't promise a regular publication frequency for my new posts, so come back here often to check in order not to miss anything! ðŸ˜Š*

Anyway, the title of this post is referred to me. It's intentionally general and yes, it can sound a bit like I'm bragging at random, but trust me if I say that it has nothing to do with it and I intend it in another way. Put that aside for now.

### Some context first

I'm a very curious person. I've practically always wondered about how things work and why they are like that, so for me it's almost natural and spontaneous to go in search of answers. It's something I voluntarily do simply because knowing something makes me feel better and more aware of the world around me, even of the little details.

That's one of the reasons why I started learning programming early in middle school (up to the eighth-grade equivalent for USA/UK).

The first thing that I needed was to know English.

One of the main reasons was because I realized that the Internet was the best place to learn something easily and finding good explanations and tutorials on the Internet in Italian is way harder than in English. There's simply more content and it is of *higher quality*.

I was fortunate because for some years I had already started watching English videos, so, with the help of subtitles, I rapidly increased my ability to understand English content, both spoken and written. I'm still learning, by the way, but I got the foundations at that time, and they were so important and useful for the following years!

Once learned English I was finally able to expand my range of possible content to use.

Looking back over the years, I feel very lucky for having such a big place to satisfy my curiosity.

### But what did I wantd to learn?

Since I was a child I loved using computers. The possibility of doing what you want (playing a game, saving images, writing text, creating filesâ€¦) without worrying about physical things was like magic for me.

As I grew up, I became interested in simple (like MS Office) and then more and more advanced software (like Blender for 3D stuff) and, in parallel, I cultivated a passion for videogames.

Spending every day a bit of time on the computer, I slowly and almost accidentally unveiled what was behind the things I was using that made them work, and so I glimpsed the beauty of programming.

This process was guided by my tendency **to go beyond appearances and to look closer and more accurately at the things I don't know**.

I insist a lot on this point not because I want to brag about it, I don't care at all about that, but because I think it's the attitude to always have in life and that everyone should apply for himself.

I decided that being a programmer was what I wanted for my future, and I immediately started to learn how to become it.

YouTube was my main source of knowledge and I'm still using it a lot, especially because it turned out to be very rich in Computer science/ICT related educational content. It's a really (I mean, *really*!) great place for learning, and even if it's not the best tool for that, at least it's completely free and you can absorb new knowledge anytime/anywhere you want.

Navigating the Internet turned out to be another very useful way to collect knowledge, too.

Year after year I first learned HTML and CSS (for making websites), then the basics of some programming languages like JavaScript, Python and C++. I created many little projects, get used to the programmer's mindset and also worked with some programs like Android Studio, Blender and Unity.

I decided to learn how to use Unity because of my passion for videogames. Again, I had noticed that when I was playing a video game I was always super curious to know exactly how a certain mechanic was made, how the characters and objects were animated, how the special effects were recreated and many other things. Unity seemed the right program for me, so I slowly started using it, with the help of many tutorials on YouTube and forums on the Internet.

### Ok, but what's the point?

I started learning early and for myself because I had (and I still have) an important philosophy of life to follow: "**don't waste time, do it now**". I didn't want to have regrets about *not having started doing something earlier*, and seeing on the Internet people of my same age (I was 13-14, now I'm 16) or even younger making cool and clever things strongly confirmed that philosophy and proved that *I can always do better, no matter what age I am*. It's not too early to act and it's always better to do now before it's too late!

Now I am attending the upper secondary school (high school) and that's oriented to Computer science.

Particularly I'm in the third year, so after the common two-year period my classmates and I have now started to really get into ICT and programming.

I'm really happy about that: we are learning C++ and C language and I'm finally learning things that I know will be useful for my future life as a developer.

But the fact that I went ahead over the past few years put me in the situation of already knowing the basics in-depth, and it is much easier for me to understand what is being explained compared to my classmates.

### A matter of perspective

This is a strange and rare situation for me: on one hand I'm happy to learn more easily and quickly the things explained in class and to help my friends, but on the other hand I get the ***perspective*** of someone who already knows that topic and watches someone learn it, with all the obstacles and doubts that arise while doing it. It's like watching yourself of the past through a mirror, it's *weird* but also *interesting*.

At school (during IT lessons, at least), I tried how it feels like to already know things and I had the opportunity to notice how others see things when they do not yet know them, a perspective that a student normally does not have because it's living that situation in first person!

That's how every teacher feels when he teaches students, but everything is overturned from the perspective of a student that already knows what is being taught. Uff!

### The debate

Just today an interesting and very constructive discussion arose in the classroom among my classmates about ***what to do in our future***.

Among us, young programmers, some had confused ideas, those who fantasized about becoming inexplicably millionaires, those who wanted to be freelancers and those who aimed to create websites, programs, apps or video games.

As for me, I said that I did not have a precise idea of what to do in the future, probably an independent programmer, but I told about the [projects](https://github.com/SamMed05) I have done in the past years, noticing a ***great*** interest in my words.

And equally interesting questions arose, such as:
> "*When did you start your first serious project?"* <br/>
"*Where did you get the motivation?"* <br/>
"*Did you do it all yourself?"* <br/>
"*Where did you learn X?"* <br/>
"*How did you do it?"* <br/>
*"Where did you start from?"* <br/>
 etc.

That's why I wrote this post. Those questions got me thinking: they represent what inexperienced students want to know while they are learning something of which they do not really know the usefulness.

They also demonstrate that, even if they know how to make a little program in C++, they actually know absolutely **nothing** about how life as a normal developer/programmer works outside of the school setting. No idea, simply because **they have never been**.

But I think that at school it's not important just to *learn* a thing, but also the **context** around it, *how* it's used, *where* it's used and the general application of that knowledge in the life of a developer, who uses creativity to give birth to his works and not only simple rules.

Instead of perpetually jumping between theory and simple exercises only, it's probably better to teach also the mindset and the attitude to have while learning, and also occasionally make a bigger, more meaningful project that teaches not only how to behave in the single case but how to do it in a larger set of situations and in a more programmer-like way.

If the ultimate goal of school, talking about my field of study (Information Technology), is to "*churn out*" good, well-formed programmers, then this is not the best way to educate us.

Luckily it is still early to draw conclusions: there are still two years to go!

### Final thoughts

Before leaving, there's something important I missed to mention: after doing that discussion with my classmates, we compared ourselves to each other and this brought out a great desire to act and to do something, more than I've ever seen before, I think. It convinced many people to ***stop doing nothing*** and ***start making something***.

For me this is a really big achievement: changing people's mindset and attitude to act for the future, instead of just doing nothing every afternoon (or whenever we have useful free time to use) makes me extremely pleased.

Most likely this little "revolution" led to just ephemeral (yet strong and decisive) intentions for having active attitudes. Intentions that will probably remain in their heads for just a day or two and then fly away. But at least my story has been able to change someone's mind in the right way, hopefully not just for a while but for all of their future! ðŸ˜„
