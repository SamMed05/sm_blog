Actually you can consider this entire blog as an "about page".

I am an italian 16 year old boy who loves programming and learning new things.
I'm attending the second year of upper secondary school in the IT technical institute, but everything you see here is done by learning the skills I needed as a self-taught.
Indeed I like experimenting with pretty much every aspect of developing in general and trying out new things to learn from them to improve myself.
For now I have done work in software, web and videogame development, but I also experiment with fractals (2D and 3D) and sometimes I have fun making logos and drawings.
Currently I'm not specialized in any of these fields in particular, I'm still finding the best one for me.
I hope you like this blog, and thank you for being here! üòÅ
