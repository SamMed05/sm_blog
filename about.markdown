Hi, I'm Samuel Mediani. You can consider this entire blog as an *about page*, but here you will find a brief summary. <br>
I am an italian 16 year old boy who loves programming and learning new things.
I'm attending the second year of upper secondary school in the IT technical institute, but everything you see here is done by learning the skills I needed as a self-taught.
Indeed I like experimenting with pretty much every aspect of developing in general and trying out new things to learn from them to improve myself.
For now I have done work in software, web and videogame development, but I also experiment with fractals (2D and 3D) and sometimes I have fun making logos and drawings.
Currently I'm not specialized in any of these fields in particular, I'm still finding the best one for me. <br>

My aim for this blog are multiple: explore and share reflections, ideas and solutions about life, but also share interesting passions, discoveries and stories that I experience and possess during my living. <br>
It's basically a public diary where I write my thoughts and other things to keep and preserve but at the same time also show them to someone else so that he can read them too. <br>
I really like the idea of leaving the mark of my life experience to my posterity and contributing to the evolution of mind and life awareness.
