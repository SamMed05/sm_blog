Hi, I'm Samuel Mediani. You can consider this entire blog as an *about page*, but here you will find a brief summary. <br>
I am an italian 16 year old boy who loves programming and learning new things.
I'm attending the second year of upper secondary school in the IT technical institute, but everything you see here is done by learning the skills I needed as a self-taught.
Indeed I like experimenting with pretty much every aspect of developing in general and trying out new things to learn from them to improve myself.
For now I have done work in software, web and videogame development, but I also experiment with fractals (2D and 3D) and sometimes I have fun making logos and drawings.
Currently I'm not specialized in any of these fields in particular, I'm still finding the best one for me. <br>

My aim is to explore and share reflections, ideas and solutions about life through this blog. <br>
Most of the time I will write referring to concepts, topics and ideas that are not mine.
After several time doing what I do everyday I get experience and I discover new things, including those of other people and different fields of knowledge. <br>
Here, then, I'll explain and keep just what I consider to be the best ones, the most worthy and relevant that I encounter in my personal life. In this way *you* too can know and live these things without needing as much time as it took me to let them become part of my life.

I really like the idea of leaving the mark of my life experience to my posterity and contributing to the evolution of mind and life awareness.
