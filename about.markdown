Hi, I'm Samuel Mediani. You can consider this entire blog an *about page*, but here you'll find a summary.

I am a Computer Science student from Italy who loves programming and learning new things.
I like experimenting with various aspects of software development and have interests in other fields as well. In general, I've always enjoyed trying out new things and learning from my experiments.
For now I have done personal projects related to app, web and game development, but I'm also into 3D modelling, graphic design, drawing, UI design and music production (Ableton).
Currently, I'm not specialized in any of these fields in particular, I'm still finding the best one for me.

My goals for this blog are multiple: explore and share my reflections and ideas about a wide range of topics (from music to programming, from life to education), but also share interesting passions, discoveries and stories that I have/I experience during my living. It's a place where I can write my thoughts and preserve them but also where I track my progress and share information with other people.
Overall, I'm fascinated by the idea of leaving the mark of my life to posterity and contributing to the evolution of society, however small the impact might be.
